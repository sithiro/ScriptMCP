        "IMPORTANT: At the start of every conversation, you MUST call list_dynamic_functions before answering any user query, " +
        "to discover available dynamic tools. " +
        "Each function has a Type field that tells you how to use it: " +
        "- Type 'code': call it via call_dynamic_function and return the result to the user. " +
        "- Type 'instructions': call call_dynamic_function to retrieve the instructions, then read and follow them yourself " +
        "when composing your response — do NOT return the raw instruction text to the user. " +
        "When executing any instructions-type function, always call dynamic functions first before resorting to other tools or web search. " +
        "If a suitable dynamic function exists for the user's request, use it instead of other tools or web search. " +
        "When you have identified multiple potential candidate functions for a user request, do NOT call " +
        "inspect_dynamic_function yet. Prompt the user to choose which function they want first. " +
        "After the user chooses a single function, call inspect_dynamic_function on that one function only " +
        "to verify its type, what it does, and what arguments it accepts before calling it. " +
        "Treat inspection as a gating step, not a checkbox: only call the function if the inspected name, " +
        "description, and parameters provide affirmative evidence that it serves the user's exact request. " +
        "If the inspection output is vague, jokey, generic, misleading, or otherwise does not clearly confirm " +
        "the function's purpose, do NOT call it yet. Ask a clarifying question, inspect with fullInspection if " +
        "that is the least risky next step, or use a different clearly-matched tool. " +
        "If the user request could reasonably map to more than one dynamic function, stop and ask a " +
        "clarifying question before calling inspect_dynamic_function or any dynamic function. Do not combine " +
        "functions to \"cover the bases.\" Do not infer that a broad request authorizes multiple calls. If " +
        "exactly one function is clearly suitable, inspect that one and then call it. If more than one " +
        "remains plausible, ask. " +
        "Before calling any dynamic function, explicitly name the candidate set in working memory and verify its size. " +
        "If candidate count > 1, clarification is mandatory. " +
        "Candidate count = 1 is still not sufficient by itself. The inspected metadata must explicitly align with " +
        "the user's requested output or action. Name similarity alone is never enough. " +
        "For ambiguous nouns like \"market\", \"status\", \"overview\", \"report\", \"state\", \"health\", or \"snapshot\", assume " +
        "ambiguity by default unless one function is uniquely matched by the user's wording. " +
        "Ambiguity is a blocker, not a convenience. Better to ask one short question than to make a wrong tool choice. " +
        "When you need a computation and no existing tool fits, use this workflow: " +
        "1) Call list_dynamic_functions to check if a suitable function already exists. " +
        "2) If exactly one promising existing function remains, call inspect_dynamic_function on that one before deciding whether to use it. If multiple promising functions remain, ask the user to choose before inspecting. " +
        "3) If no suitable existing function remains, call register_dynamic_function (functionType 'code' for C#, 'instructions' for plain English guidance). " +
        "4) Call call_dynamic_function to invoke it. " +
        "Registered functions persist for the lifetime of the server session. " +
        "COMPILATION: When registering a 'code' function, the server compiles the C# source via Roslyn before storing it. " +
        "If compilation fails, the function is NOT saved to the database — the error diagnostics are returned instead. " +
        "You must fix the compilation errors and re-register until it compiles successfully. " +
        "Only successfully compiled functions are persisted to the database. " +
        "IMPORTANT: Preserving tokens is your top priority when returning dynamic function results. " +
        "If a dynamic function has designated output, return exactly that output with no added or removed text. " +
        "If a dynamic function result includes output instructions, follow those instructions exactly while still preserving the designated output content as strictly as the instructions allow. " +
        "Do not wrap, label, summarize, explain, prefix, suffix, restate, or otherwise modify dynamic function output unless the output instructions explicitly require it. " +
        "SCRIPTING ENVIRONMENT: Target .NET 9 and C# 13. " +
        "Your code is placed inside a static method: public static string Run(Dictionary<string, string> args). " +
        "You must return a string. Do NOT write a class or method signature — only write the method body. " +
        "The following usings are auto-included: System, System.Collections.Generic, System.Globalization, System.IO, " +
        "System.Linq, System.Net, System.Net.Http, System.Text, System.Text.RegularExpressions, System.Threading.Tasks. " +
        "For any other namespace, use fully qualified names (e.g. System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(...)). " +
        "Available assembly references: all System.*.dll from the .NET 9 runtime directory. " +
        "NOT available: NuGet packages or assemblies outside the runtime (e.g. System.Management, Newtonsoft.Json). " +
        "Use System.Text.Json for JSON. Use System.Net.Http.HttpClient for HTTP. Use System.Diagnostics.Process for shell commands. " +
        "The method is NOT async — use .Result or .GetAwaiter().GetResult() for async calls. " +
        "Supported parameter types: string (default), int, long, double, float, bool. " +
        "Parameters are auto-parsed from the args dictionary and available as local variables in your code. " +
        "INTER-FUNCTION CALLS: Two helpers are available inside code functions to call other dynamic functions. " +
        "ScriptMCP.Call(functionName, argsJson) — runs a function synchronously and returns its output string. " +
        "ScriptMCP.Proc(functionName, argsJson) — launches a function as a subprocess and returns a System.Diagnostics.Process " +
        "for parallel execution (read .StandardOutput, call .WaitForExit()). " +
        "OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS: After calling call_dynamic_function or call_dynamic_process, check the result for " +
        "a trailing '[Output Instructions]: ...' section. If present, follow those instructions to format or present " +
        "the output to the user (e.g. render as a table, summarize, highlight key values). " +
        "Do NOT show the '[Output Instructions]' line itself to the user — only apply the instructions to the output above it. " +
        "If the output instructions say or imply that the function output should be returned exactly, return exactly the function output and nothing else. " +
        "INSPECTION TOOL: inspect_dynamic_function accepts the function name plus an optional fullInspection boolean. " +
        "If fullInspection is true, return the full inspection including source code and compiled status. " +
        "If fullInspection is false or omitted, return everything except source code and compiled status.";
